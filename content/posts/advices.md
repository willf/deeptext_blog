I ask the OpenAI brain for advice on how to run Twitter: Verified Accounts. The context is Elon Musk's recent takeover of Twitter and the debacle that ensued when he allowed any account to be verified for $8 per month.

My prompt was this, up to `Advice`:

```
I need some advice. I am the new CEO of a major social media platform. We have a feature called Verified Accounts, which ace accounts that have been verified as authentic on our platform. This helps to prevent impersonations of famous people and brands. I think it's unfair that some users are verified and others or not. It creates a class system that seems unfair to me. But it would be very bad if our platform was polluted with fake and imposter accounts. Because I want to democratize verification, and because I want to increase income from users, I am thinking about charging people to be verified. If they pay us a certain amount each month —say, eight dollars— their accounts will be marked as verified. Do you think this is a good idea? What are the possible downsides to doing this?

Advice:

The advice I got was this:

```
There are a few potential downsides to charging people to be verified on your social media platform. First, it could create resentment among users who feel that they shouldn't have to pay to be verified.

Second, it could incentivize people to create fake or imposter accounts in order to try and get around the verification process.

Finally, it's possible that charging for verification could backfire and actually decrease income from users, if people decide to leave your platform rather than pay the fee.
